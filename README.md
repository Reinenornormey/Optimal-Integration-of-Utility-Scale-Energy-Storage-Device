# Optimal-Integration-of-Utility-Scale-Energy-Storage-Device
This project aims to find the optimal placement and sizing of stationary storage devices in a power network in 
presence of distributed renewable energy sources. The level of detail is adapted to a feasibility assessment which 
is an essential step before the design stage where more precise calculations need to be done. The power generation 
is coming from classic generator, solar generator, and wind generator.
